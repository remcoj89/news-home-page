## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

After the project I have a better understanding of how to read the design file and create css variables with use of the style guide. I know now how to measer the padding, margin, etc from the design file and learend to use the clamp selector.

### Continued development

I will continue to improve the project planning and structure with the help of the design file and building more complex projects with more js involved. and I will learn to build a next.js project

### Useful resources

- [https://www.zerotomastery.io] - This helped me to learn how to read the design file.
- [https://youtu.be/U9VF-4euyRo?si=2OHZVWNfmho-HItf] - This is an amazing video which helped me finally understand responsive styling for text using the css clamp. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
